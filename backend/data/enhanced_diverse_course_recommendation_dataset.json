Today, robots are built for applications as diverse as exploring remote planets, de-mining war zones, cleaning toxic waste, assembling cars, inspecting pipes in industrial plants and mowing lawns. Robots are also interacting with humans in a variety of ways: robots are museum guides, robots assist surgeon sin life threatening operations, and robotic cars can drive us around. The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today\u2019s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions.

Whatever happens, the fate of a post-mortem body is little talked about and often ignored until we\u2019re faced with the death of someone we know. In the United States, traditional burial and cremation are the two most common options for body disposition. Recently, newer and more environmentally friendly options, such as water cremation and human composting, have been introduced. Yet these are rarely available or legal in only a few states. How should American society determine what happens to its dead? This course will discuss everything that may happen to a body after death, from decomposition to body disposition to organ donations. Students will learn the history and reasons behind the legalization and practice of body disposition methods. They will analyze what makes treatment of the dead body respectful or vilified in the United States. With no exams in this course, students will complete projects which include researching a funeral option from another culture and writing a letter to a state representative."

Or is a Black aesthetic best exemplified by the manipulation of materials, visual composition, and saturation? Or both? We will engage theories of black art and aesthetics that emerged in the 1920s through today to take seriously the question: how does the visual life of blackness matter? In this class we will break through the traditional rhetoric of diversity and representation and discuss how artists over the decades have insisted instead on redistributions of power, radical and speculative material practices, and structural change.

Furthermore, students will gain hands-on research experience in trial projects provided by different laboratories in APP through mini-rotations (3 weeks per laboratory). The primary goal of this course is to assist first-year APP students to find Ph.D. advisors by the end of the fall semester so they can start Ph.D. research in the spring semester. Additionally, this course aims to provide first-year APP students with an opportunity to develop a genuine camaraderie within the cohort by spending time together. Furthermore, each first-year student will be mentored by a senior APP student throughout the semester to get fully integrated into the program and the Rice community. Recommended Prerequisite(s): Understanding of undergraduate-level classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, and solid-state physics"

We will explore that fascination in a wide-ranging sample of writing by such authors as Kate Chopin, William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, Walker Percy, Eudora Welty, John Kennedy Toole, Michael Ondaatje, Sarah Broom, Maurice Carlos Ruffin, Eric Nguyen, and others. We will try to understand some of the many ways in which these writers have used this mysterious, complex, and magnetic place, striving to explain its survival despite and in some cases because of the social, legal, cultural, and environmental storms that have battered it. Our reading will be balanced between texts long ago admitted to the canon of classic American literature (Streetcar Named Desire, A Confederacy of Dunces) and texts that are part of a recent remarkable outburst of creative energy associated with the post-Katrina city (Ruffin\u2019s short stories; Sarah Broom\u2019s The Yellow House). The food, drink, and music of New Orleans will receive special attention as key parts of the city\u2019s cultural fabric. A final paper will ask you to write your own New Orleans: to build a verbal monument from the foundations of these other attempts to capture the city\u2019s essence in words."

We will begin in medieval Spain and then track their development through modernity, paying close attention to how these discourses changed and evolved over time; in the second part, we will look at the impact of the Holocaust and the rise of the State of Israel and consider current iterations of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in Europe and America today.

Computational Geophysics 2. Reservoir Simulation Fundamentals 3. Machine Learning The first two components will be taught together in the first 10 weeks by dedicating half of the class-time to each subject. The Machine Learning component will, in part, build on the first two fundamental components and will be taught using the full class time. Computational Geophysics The participants in this geophysics part of the course are expected to be interested into learn how to use modern seismic data to image the subsurface with awareness of the computational costs of the techniques involved. The main focus will be given to current seismic imaging tools including cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) applications. As the result of the successful completion of this course part, the course participants should be able to: (1) Understand the context and value of imaging tools for the hydrocarbon exploration business. (2) Relate the imaging tools with their computational costs for modern computer resources. (3) Properly use wave-based geophysical imaging and ML-based tools and (4) Understand main seismic processing and interpretation decisions. Applied Reservoir Simulation This component of the course will introduce participants to the practice of reservoir simulation. This class will be an applied course on reservoir simulation. Theoretical descriptions will be provided as warranted but will be kept to minimum. Class participants will learn about the fundamentals of applied reservoir simulation, use of a reservoir simulator, and how to select the proper model for a simulation study. This course will also cover data preparation, grid design, calibration of the reservoir model, forecasting of future performance, and interpretation of simulation results. Participants will also be introduced to the role of simulation in reservoir management, limitations of reservoir simulation, and the structural aspects of the models. Upscaling and recent advances simulation techniques will also be discussed. A realistic open-source reservoir simulation software will be used during the tutorials and computer projects. Machine Learning for Oil & Gas This part of the course will introduce the fundamentals of statistical learning, present a few of the popular learning paradigms and algorithms, and culminate in a small student project applying them to an oil reservoir data set using the R programming language (solutions to class problems will be accepted in any programming language or system). Much of the material presented here is also known under the names \u201cBig Data\u201d, \u201cData Analytics\u201d, \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d, \u201cData Mining\u201d, \u201cPetroleum Data Driven Analytics\u201d and other terms. Weeks 11 and 12 are theory only, weeks 13-15 will have small hands-on exercises incorporated and week 16 and 17 are dedicated to solving a simple oil reservoir problem using machine learning."

Over time, our inefficient habits of movement, and the decreased suppleness of muscle tissue that occurs naturally as we age can lead to reduced mobility of joints and compromised body positions. Staying active and stretching regularly reduces the chance of experiencing occasional and chronic musculoskeletal pain and helps prevent this loss of mobility.

The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story? In this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice."

Whatever happens, the fate of a post-mortem body is little talked about and often ignored until we\u2019re faced with the death of someone we know. In the United States, traditional burial and cremation are the two most common options for body disposition. Recently, newer and more environmentally friendly options, such as water cremation and human composting, have been introduced. Yet these are rarely available or legal in only a few states. How should American society determine what happens to its dead? This course will discuss everything that may happen to a body after death, from decomposition to body disposition to organ donations. Students will learn the history and reasons behind the legalization and practice of body disposition methods. They will analyze what makes treatment of the dead body respectful or vilified in the United States. With no exams in this course, students will complete projects which include researching a funeral option from another culture and writing a letter to a state representative."

In the first half of this seminar, we will explore the history of social design and how anthropological culture theory and its insights into the interpretation of meaning (e.g., Geertz) have directly impacted practices of social design. We will also explore how design\u2019s concern with innovation and futurity has attracted interest from public anthropologists interested not only in analyzing the world as it stands but also changing it for the better. In the second half of the course, the seminar will incorporate studio exercises where students will work in teams to practice social design skills through public-engaged projects to identify problems that are susceptible to social design solutions. Cross-list: ANTH 568. Recommended Prerequisite(s): There are no specific prerequisites for this course.

This landmark achievement is just the beginning of a new era of human therapeutics. This class will discuss the gene therapy field \u2013 where it was and where it is now. Clinically important vectors currently under human testing, and opportunities for the next generation of improved gene delivery vectors will be presented. The biological and physiological barriers to efficient gene delivery will be investigated in order to spur new ideas for improving vector efficiency and specificity. Cross-list: BIOE 422.

In this course, rather than focusing on technical details, we will focus on highlighting for a broad, basic linear-algebra-savvy audience, the simplicity and generality of some core linear algebraic ideas. In particular, we will focus on two fundamental and much used matrix problems which have been at the center of recent developments: (1) Least Squares approximation and (2) Low-Rank Matrix Approximation. A key tool for achieving this goal are randomized algorithms which originated in TCS. Cross-list: ELEC 506."

Whatever happens, the fate of a post-mortem body is little talked about and often ignored until we\u2019re faced with the death of someone we know. In the United States, traditional burial and cremation are the two most common options for body disposition. Recently, newer and more environmentally friendly options, such as water cremation and human composting, have been introduced. Yet these are rarely available or legal in only a few states. How should American society determine what happens to its dead? This course will discuss everything that may happen to a body after death, from decomposition to body disposition to organ donations. Students will learn the history and reasons behind the legalization and practice of body disposition methods. They will analyze what makes treatment of the dead body respectful or vilified in the United States. With no exams in this course, students will complete projects which include researching a funeral option from another culture and writing a letter to a state representative."

STS is a field that focuses on how power is infused in how we create scientific knowledge, how we disseminate \u201cobjective\u201d information, and how it materializes in the technology we build into our everyday lives. However, how might we better understand \u201cscience\u201d through an intersectional framework that attends to race, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously? Drawing on critical methods of speculation, the course will address the following themes: the role of racism in social reproduction through the body from colonialism and slavery to contemporary genomics; humanism; the racialization of physical matter and space; and concluding with Afrofuturism. In addition to mobilizing the theories and concepts developed to bear witness to the particularity of Black womxns lived experience, this class has us consider what Black feminism can teach us about how to reckon with building a more with just and equitable world with science and technology against various oppressive forces.

Is a Black aesthetic inherently revolutionary and interested in the political lives of black people and their liberation? Or is a Black aesthetic best exemplified by the manipulation of materials, visual composition, and saturation? Or both? We will engage theories of black art and aesthetics that emerged in the 1920s through today to take seriously the question: how does the visual life of blackness matter? In this class we will break through the traditional rhetoric of diversity and representation and discuss how artists over the decades have insisted instead on redistributions of power, radical and speculative material practices, and structural change. It is my priority to make this course on black aesthetics joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities. Cross-list: AAAS 204."

With selected works from artists of diverse backgrounds, we will discuss the artist and the work\u2019s social/historical context, symbolism and meaning, and ways artists play with words and language structures. We will also discuss the genre\u2019s broader linguistic significance and contributions to social progress. There are no exams and no *home*work other than occasional small reflections and the final project, where students create their own multilingual rap conscient with the optional help of ChatGPT. All other class-related work is reflective and designed to be completed in class, though students are always welcome to explore course-related questions more deeply between classes and share findings. Linking language learning with the communicative intent of 'le rap conscient', we consider our essential question: How can understanding 'le rap conscient' and its various roles help us envision a just world?"

Designed for anyone interested in Francophone society or creative writing for social justice, this English-taught course explores language\u2019s social change potential through 'le rap conscient', a socially and linguistically significant Francophone music genre that holds up a mirror to society to encourage social change. With selected works from artists of diverse backgrounds, we will discuss the artist and the work\u2019s social/historical context, symbolism and meaning, and ways artists play with words and language structures. We will also discuss the genre\u2019s broader linguistic significance and contributions to social progress. There are no exams and no *home*work other than occasional small reflections and the final project, where students create their own multilingual rap conscient with the optional help of ChatGPT. All other class-related work is reflective and designed to be completed in class, though students are always welcome to explore course-related questions more deeply between classes and share findings. Linking language learning with the communicative intent of 'le rap conscient', we consider our essential question: How can understanding 'le rap conscient' and its various roles help us envision a just world?"

These include theoretical computer science (TCS), numerical linear algebra (NLA), statistics, applied mathematics, data analysis, machine learning, etc. As a consequence of the multi-disciplinarity of the area, researchers often fail to appreciate the underlying connections and the significance of contributions developed outside their own area. In this course, rather than focusing on technical details, we will focus on highlighting for a broad, basic linear-algebra-savvy audience, the simplicity and generality of some core linear algebraic ideas. In particular, we will focus on two fundamental and much used matrix problems which have been at the center of recent developments: (1) Least Squares approximation and (2) Low-Rank Matrix Approximation. A key tool for achieving this goal are randomized algorithms which originated in TCS. Cross-list: ELEC 406."
