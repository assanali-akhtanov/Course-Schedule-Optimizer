The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story? In this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice."}, "negative": {"course_code": "RELI 533", "course_name": "EDITING AND PUBLISHING PRACTICUM", "description": "This practicum involves real-world experience in the production of one of the journals in the Department of Religion at Rice University.

Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story? In this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously.

More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story? In this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice."}, "negative": {"course_code": "HART 328", "course_name": "EPIPHANIES: SEEING IN A NEW LIGHT AND RECOGNIZING THE RADIANCE", "description": "Epiphanies are events or objects that can note a striking appearance or manifestation, just as an epiphanic experience contains a significant moment of revelation.

The unifying thread among these case studies is a focus on lines of evidence, with the goal of exposing students to the diverse methods of archaeology: how can archaeologists determine the impacts of humans upon animals and vice versa, and how well are their interpretations supported by their data? Finally, we consider how knowledge of the past can help shape our approaches to animals and their environments today, with respect for the planet that we all share. Cross-list: ANTH 352.

The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story? In this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice."}, "negative": {"course_code": "MECH 592", "course_name": "DESIGN FOR AEROSPACE ENVIRONMENTS", "description": "Graduate course on aerospace environments, including theoretical bases.

The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story? In this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice."}, "negative": {"course_code": "BIOS 353", "course_name": "MICROBIOLOGY: THE MOLECULAR BASIS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THEIR\nTREATMENT", "description": "BIOS 353 is a one-semester course that surveys a representative group of bacterial and viral infectious diseases and the medical countermeasures used to defeat them or in some cases just keep them in check.

The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story?

More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story?

How should American society determine what happens to its dead? This course will discuss everything that may happen to a body after death, from decomposition to body disposition to organ donations. Students will learn the history and reasons behind the legalization and practice of body disposition methods. They will analyze what makes treatment of the dead body respectful or vilified in the United States. With no exams in this course, students will complete projects which include researching a funeral option from another culture and writing a letter to a state representative."}}, {"query": "I am interested in data science", "positive": {"course_code": "ELEC 450", "course_name": "ALGORITHMIC ROBOTICS", "description": "Robots have fascinated people for generations.

Until recently, most algorithms for solving inferential and estimation problems have iteratively applied static models derived from physics or intuition. In this course, we will explore a new approach that is based on \u201clearning\u201d various elements of the problem including i) stepsizes and parameters of iterative algorithms, ii) regularizers, and iii) inverse functions. For example, we will explore a new approach for solving inverse problems that is based on transforming an iterative, physics-based algorithm into a deep network whose parameters can be learned from training data. For a range of different inverse problems, deep networks have been shown to offer faster convergence to a better quality solution. Specific topics to be discussed include: Ill-posed inverse problems, iterative optimization, deep learning, neural networks, learning regularizers. This is a \u201creading course,\u201d meaning that students will read and present classic and recent papers from the technical literature to the rest of the class in a lively debate format. Discussions will aim at identifying common themes and important trends in the field.

The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story? In this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice."}, "negative": {"course_code": "HIST 345", "course_name": "THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES' ENGAGEMENT WITH ASIA, 1780 TO THE\nPRESENT", "description": "The general survey of the United States' engagement with a region that would cohere as the Asia-Pacific World through the 19th and 20th centuries.
