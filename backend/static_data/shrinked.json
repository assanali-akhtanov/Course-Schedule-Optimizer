[{"id": "AAAS 204", "name": "INTRODUCTION TO BLACK ART IN AMERICA: 1900S TO TODAY", "description": "This class examines the history of Black art in America since the early 1900s. What is Black Art? Who are the artists, curators, scholars, and theorists who have asked and answered this question over the decades? Is a Black aesthetic inherently revolutionary and interested in the political lives of black people and their liberation? Or is a Black aesthetic best exemplified by the manipulation of materials, visual composition, and saturation? Or both? We will engage theories of black art and aesthetics that emerged in the 1920s through today to take seriously the question: how does the visual life of blackness matter? In this class we will break through the traditional rhetoric of diversity and representation and discuss how artists over the decades have insisted instead on redistributions of power, radical and speculative material practices, and structural change. It is my priority to make this course on black aesthetics joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities.

The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story? In this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice."}, {"id": "SWGS 315", "name": "GENDER AND ISLAM", "description": "Explores the lives of Muslim women in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and North America; analyzes constructions of gender in the Islamic world overtime; the challenges faced from such diverse quarters as colonial administrators, Western feminists, and states; as well as movements and individuals within the Muslim world.

The Machine Learning component will, in part, build on the first two fundamental components and will be taught using the full class time. Computational Geophysics The participants in this geophysics part of the course are expected to be interested into learn how to use modern seismic data to image the subsurface with awareness of the computational costs of the techniques involved. The main focus will be given to current seismic imaging tools including cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) applications. As the result of the successful completion of this course part, the course participants should be able to: (1) Understand the context and value of imaging tools for the hydrocarbon exploration business. (2) Relate the imaging tools with their computational costs for modern computer resources. (3) Properly use wave-based geophysical imaging and ML-based tools and (4) Understand main seismic processing and interpretation decisions.

Class participants will learn about the fundamentals of applied reservoir simulation, use of a reservoir simulator, and how to select the proper model for a simulation study. This course will also cover data preparation, grid design, calibration of the reservoir model, forecasting of future performance, and interpretation of simulation results. Participants will also be introduced to the role of simulation in reservoir management, limitations of reservoir simulation, and the structural aspects of the models. Upscaling and recent advances simulation techniques will also be discussed. A realistic open-source reservoir simulation software will be used during the tutorials and computer projects.
